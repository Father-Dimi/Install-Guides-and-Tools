# Starting Point
## In this we will discuss terminal text editors.


### Nano
out of all of these this one is the most beginner-friendly, although its not recommended for editing large files due to its lack of features. You may enter it into a file by typing `nano fileyouwanttomodify`
and you will be able to edit the file. When you wish to save press `ctrl+o` then press enter then type `ctrl+x` to exit

### Vim
The notoriously hard text-editor. Vim (stands for vi-improved) 
is a superset of the earlier text-editor vi
you may enter vim via typing `vim fileyouwanttomodify` apon entering you will not be able to modify text
because you are in "command mode" you must press the letter "i" on your keyboard and then you will be able to edit text, when you are done press the "esc" key and then type
- :w (to write aka save)
- :x (to exit and save)
- :q (to quit)
- :q! (to quit without saving)

you can view a large wiki of command at [Vim-Fandom](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vim_Tips_Wiki)

### Emacs
emacs is a another early made text-editor
you can enter it via typing `emacs fileyouwanttomodify`
you may instantly start editing text and you can save by pressing the "save" button
